First, I need to ensure the website addresses both services effectively. Maybe separate sections for cleaning and fumigation to highlight each. The target audience is likely homeowners or renters looking for reliable, trustworthy services. They might value transparency, ease of booking, and clear information on safety and certifications.

Key pages would be Home, Services, Booking, About Us, Blog, Contact, and maybe a separate FAQ. Features like online booking, service add-ons, and certifications are important. Trust signals like customer reviews, before/after galleries, and safety badges are crucial here. Also, since it's local, emphasizing service areas and local partnerships could help.

I should think about the unique selling points. Maybe eco-friendly cleaning options or a satisfaction guarantee. The user might need features like real-time quotes, SMS reminders, and a loyalty program. The twist could be something like a video diagnostic tool for fumigation issues, which adds interactivity.

Need to ensure mobile optimization since local searches are often on mobile. SEO tips should include local keywords like "house cleaning in [City]." Also, integrating Google My Business and social proof from platforms like Yelp or Nextdoor would be beneficial.

Wait, in the previous response, the user mentioned fumigation, so safety and certifications are even more important here. Maybe include details on chemicals used, licenses, and insurance. Emergency services could be another key point, with a prominent emergency contact button.

I should structure the response with sections for website structure, features, content tips, marketing strategies, and tech stack. Make sure to cover all aspects from user trust to practical booking features. Also, include modern essentials like mobile-first design and analytics. Maybe suggest a unique feature like the video diagnostic tool to stand out.
